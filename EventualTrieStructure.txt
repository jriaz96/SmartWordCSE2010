            Add w to Trie with weight 1
                This weight is added to each letter in the word at the correct position
            Example:
                w = "dips"
                trie =                  d,1
                                       /    \
                                      i,1    o,1
                                     /   \     \
                                    p,1   r,1   [leaf,1]
                                   /       \
                               [leaf,1]     t,1
                                             \
                                             [leaf,1]
                trie.add(w,weight)
                trie =                  d,2
                                       /    \
                                      i,2    o,1
                                     /   \    \
                                    p,2   r,1   [leaf,1]
                                   / \      \
                           [leaf,1]   s,1    t,1
                                      /         \
                                 [leaf,1]      [leaf,1]
            leaf for each will hold actual frequency for that word
            each letter holds the frequency of that letter in that order
            this allows for guesses to be shorter words
